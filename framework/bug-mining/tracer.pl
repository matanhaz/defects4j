=head1 NAME

get-trigger.pl -- Determines triggering tests for all reviewed version pairs in
F<work_dir/$TAB_REV_PAIRS>, or a single version (or range).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get-trigger.pl -p project_id -w work_dir [-b bug_id]  [-i bug_index]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-p C<project_id>>

The id of the project for which the meta data should be generated.

=item B<-w F<work_dir>>

The working directory used for the bug-mining process.

=item B<-b C<bug_id>>

Only analyze this bug id. The bug_id has to follow the format B<(\d+)(:(\d+))?>.
Per default all bug ids, listed in the active-bugs csv, are considered.

=item B<-i C<bug_index>>

Only analyze this bug id by index. The bug_id has to follow the format B<(\d+)(:(\d+))?>.
Per default all bug ids, listed in the active-bugs csv, are considered.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Runs the following workflow for the project C<project_id> and the results are
written to F<work_dir/TAB_TRIGGER>. For all B<reviewed> version pairs in
F<work_dir/$TAB_REV_PAIRS>:

=over 4

=item 1) Checkout fixed version.

=item 2) Compile src and test.

=item 3) Run tests and verify that all tests pass.

=item 4) Checkout buggy version.

=item 5) Compile src and test.

=item 6) Run tests and verify that no test class fails and at least on test
         method fails (all failing test methods are B<individual triggering tests>).

=item 7) Run every triggering test in isolation on the fixed version and verify
         that it passes.

=item 8) Run every triggering test in isolation on the buggy verision and verify
         that it fails.

=item 9) Export triggering tests to F<C<work_dir>/<project_id>/trigger_tests>.

=back

The result for each individual step is stored in F<C<work_dir>/$TAB_TRIGGER>.
For each step the output table contains a column, indicating the result of the
step or '-' if the step was not applicable.
