=head1 NAME

analyze-project.pl -- Determine all suitable candidates listed in the active-bugs csv.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

analyze-project.pl -p project_id -w work_dir -g tracker_name -t tracker_project_id [-b bug_id] [-i bug_index]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-p C<project_id>>

The id of the project for which the version pairs are analyzed.

=item B<-w C<work_dir>>

The working directory used for the bug-mining process.

=item B<-g C<tracker_name>>

The source control tracker name, e.g., jira, github, google, or sourceforge.

=item B<-t C<tracker_project_id>>

The name used on the issue tracker to identify the project. Note that this might
not be the same as the Defects4j project name / id, for instance, for the
commons-lang project is LANG.

=item B<-b C<bug_id>>

Only analyze this bug id. The bug_id has to follow the format B<(\d+)(:(\d+))?>.
Per default all bug ids, listed in the active-bugs csv, are considered.

=item B<-i C<bug_index>>

Only analyze this bug id by index. The bug_id has to follow the format B<(\d+)(:(\d+))?>.
Per default all bug ids, listed in the active-bugs csv, are considered.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Runs the following worflow for all candidate bugs in the project's C<active-bugs.csv>,
or (if -b is specified) for a subset of candidates:

=over 4

=item 1) Verify that src diff (between pre-fix and post-fix) is not empty.

=item 3) Checkout fixed revision.

=item 4) Compile src and test.

=item 5) Run tests and log failing tests to F<C<PROJECTS_DIR>/<PID>/failing_tests>.

=item 6) Exclude failing tests, recompile and rerun. This is repeated until
         there are no more failing tests in F<$TEST_RUNS> consecutive
         executions. (Maximum limit of looping in this phase is specified by
         F<$MAX_TEST_RUNS>).

=item 7) Checkout fixed version.

=item 8) Apply src patch (fixed -> buggy).

=item 9) Compile src and test.

=back

The result for each individual step is stored in F<C<work_dir>/$TAB_REV_PAIRS>.
For each steps the output table contains a column, indicating the result of the
the step or '-' if the step was not applicable.

Previous step in workflow: Manually verify that all test failures
(failing_tests) are valid and not spurious, broken, random, or due to classpath
issues.

Next step in workflow: F<get-trigger.pl>.
